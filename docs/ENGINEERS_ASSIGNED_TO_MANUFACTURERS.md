## Database Schema

### Engineer Assignments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE engineer_org_memberships (
    engineer_id UUID REFERENCES engineers(id),
    org_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
    role TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (engineer_id, org_id)
);
```

### Query to Get Engineers for a Manufacturer
```sql
SELECT 
    e.id, e.name, e.skills, e.email, e.phone,
    m.role
FROM engineer_org_memberships m
JOIN engineers e ON e.id = m.engineer_id
WHERE m.org_id = 'f1c1ebfb-57fd-4307-93db-2f72e9d004ad'  -- Philips
ORDER BY e.name;
```

### Query to Get Engineer Count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT engineer_id) 
FROM engineer_org_memberships 
WHERE org_id = 'f1c1ebfb-57fd-4307-93db-2f72e9d004ad';
```

## API Support Needed

### 1. Get Engineers by Manufacturer
```http
GET /api/v1/engineers?manufacturer_id={id}
or
GET /api/v1/organizations/{id}/engineers
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "engineers": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Amit Patel",
      "email": "amit.p@engineer.com",
      "phone": "+91-9876543xxx",
      "skills": ["CT Scanner", "MRI", "X-Ray"],
      "role": "Service Technician",
      "home_region": "Mumbai"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Get Engineer Count
Option A: Existing endpoint with parameter
```http
GET /api/v1/organizations/{id}?include_engineer_count=true
```

Option B: Separate count endpoint
```http
GET /api/v1/organizations/{id}/engineers/count
```

## Expected Dashboard Display

After implementing the engineers API:

**For Philips Healthcare:**
```
Equipment: 10
Engineers: 5  ← Will now show real count
Active Tickets: 0
```

**Engineer List:**
- Amit Patel - Service Technician
- Arun Menon - Service Technician
- Kavita Nair - Service Technician
- Rajesh Kumar Singh - Service Technician
- Suresh Gupta - Service Technician

Created clean structure:
```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ organizations-architecture.md (from DETAILED-ORGANIZATIONS...)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ engineer-management.md (from ENGINEER-MANAGEMENT-DESIGN.md)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ implementation-roadmap.md (from IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)
â””â”€â”€ database/
    â””â”€â”€ phase1-complete.md (from PHASE1-DATABASE-COMPLETE.md)
```

### 4. Created New Documentation

âœ… **README.md** - Comprehensive project overview with:
- Project description
- Quick start guide
- Architecture overview
- Current status
- Testing instructions
- Documentation links

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. âœ… Load Sub-Sub-sub_sub_SUB_DEALERs seed data (003_sub_Sub-Sub-sub_sub_SUB_DEALERs.sql)
2. â³ Create hospitals seed data (10 hospitals)
3. â³ Create engineers seed data (50+ engineers)
4. â³ Test complete database relationships

### Short-term:
1. Enable organizations module in backend
2. Create organizations API endpoints
3. Build engineer management APIs
4. Develop frontend UIs for organizations

### Long-term:
1. Build role-specific dashboards
2. Implement tier-based routing
3. Add performance tracking
4. Deploy to production

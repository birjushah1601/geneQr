### 3. Organized Documentation Structure

Created clean structure:
```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── organizations-architecture.md (from DETAILED-ORGANIZATIONS...)
│   ├── engineer-management.md (from ENGINEER-MANAGEMENT-DESIGN.md)
│   └── implementation-roadmap.md (from IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)
└── database/
    └── phase1-complete.md (from PHASE1-DATABASE-COMPLETE.md)
```

### 4. Created New Documentation

✅ **README.md** - Comprehensive project overview with:
- Project description
- Quick start guide
- Architecture overview
- Current status
- Testing instructions
- Documentation links

---

## 📁 Current Root Directory (Clean!)

### Essential Files Only:
- ✅ README.md (NEW!)
- ✅ DETAILED-ORGANIZATIONS-ARCHITECTURE-DESIGN.md
- ✅ ENGINEER-MANAGEMENT-DESIGN.md
- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md
- ✅ PHASE1-DATABASE-COMPLETE.md
- ✅ .env
- ✅ go.mod, go.sum, go.work
- ✅ Makefile
- ✅ cleanup-docs.ps1 (can be deleted after review)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Load dealers seed data (003_dealers.sql)
2. ⏳ Create hospitals seed data (10 hospitals)
3. ⏳ Create engineers seed data (50+ engineers)
4. ⏳ Test complete database relationships

### Short-term:
1. Enable organizations module in backend
2. Create organizations API endpoints
3. Build engineer management APIs
4. Develop frontend UIs for organizations

### Long-term:
1. Build role-specific dashboards
2. Implement tier-based routing
3. Add performance tracking
4. Deploy to production

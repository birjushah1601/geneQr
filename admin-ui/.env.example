# OpenAI API Configuration for AI-Assisted Diagnosis
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Alternative: Use OpenAI API key without NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for server-side only
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 3. Replace "your-openai-api-key-here" with your actual API key
# 4. Restart your development server

# Note: NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix makes the variable available in the browser
# For production, consider using server-side API routes to hide the key
